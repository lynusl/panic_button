## Inspiration

> En Hao’s rambles: we wrote this at 3am don’t expect much.

Getting nagged by our boss all the time for procrastinating and not doing our work on time, we decided that we need a solution to this, we need to punish ourselves. Which is why we came up with PaaS, a one stop solution, and a 10000x percent effective solution to procrastination. We wanted to share this idea with the entire world in hopes that no boss and parent will ever be pissed at you for procrastinating anymore, improving your mental health significantly.

> En Hao’s rambles: This app made me a super worker! I finished this README before I went to sleep! I didn’t need to sleep at all because I kept this app running! I love it!
>
> Lynus comment:
> Sure, here are a few quotes that summarise the concept of “urgency driving progress”:
>
> 1. Due tomorrow, do tomorrow.
> 2. Diamonds form under pressure.
> 3. The last minute is often the most productive.
>
> Aekas says: This product made me become phenomenally more productive, working 25/8 at maximal efficiency. I am eternally grateful to PaaS for changing my life.

## What it does

> En Hao’s rambles: Did you mean what we wanted it to do…? Yea, that’s just to be annoying. Like VERY ANNOYING.
>
> Oh. you meant actual functionality. Oh. ohhhhhh. Ok um. Yea.

1. When the app starts, you can alt-tab out and continue with your productive work!
2. Every X time measurements, a **BIG RED BUTTON** comes out to check if you are slacking. Are you slacking? No right?
3. What happens if you are slacking is a wonderful experience that should be experienced for yourself! Run our app to find out more!
4. To end this wonderful experience, please roll NAT20 luck check

## How we built it

- electron.js
- laptops
- visual studio code
- google
- stackoverflow

## Challenges we ran into

- create-electron-app did not work
- ran out of free Sonnet-3.5 messages
- the button bro fr I get interrupted every 15 seconds to click the button
- couldn’t get delete system32 to work

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

> Lynus comment: This app made in 24 hours is arguably more complete and polished than any of my past module projects (which were also all submitted late)
>
> Aekas says: ^^ + Best hackathon experience ever with this bunch.
>
> En Hao’s rambles: We actually built a functional app. Like straight up my first hackathon experience and my first electron development experience. 10/10 would do again with this bunch <3 and now enhanced by this same app!

## Lessons we learnt

- javascript
- electron framework
- working together as a team - epic bonding thx hack n roll
- how a hackathon works (best hackathon fr)
- Human psychology (how to irritate and annoy increase human productivity)

## What’s next?

Knowing confidently that we will achieve great success and response from this application, this team looks forward to further expanding its horizons into productivity applications and iterations of this application, to potentially 20000x productivity. In the future we will utilise and enhance our platform not only drive productivity but also fosters innovation and inclusivity, shaping a better future for all.
